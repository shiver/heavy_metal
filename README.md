Heavy Metal - Tetris clone
===========

Disclaimer: I have not worked on this project for a long time (around 2006 or 2007), but wanted to preserve its memory for both myself and anyone else who might find it interesting. I haven't touched the code, or attempted to compile it since that time. So don't expect too much.

I have also removed the sound assets as I wasn't sure if I had created them myself, or if they belonged to someone else. Since I don't intend people to actually try to use this, it shouldn't be a problem.
